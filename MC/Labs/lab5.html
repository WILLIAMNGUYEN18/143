  <div id="content">

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <div class="indented">
      <p>For lab 5, you will work more on orienting ourselves in Minecraft's 3D world. You'll do
      this by creating several different tree-growing blocks, where each tree has a characteristic
      shape: cube, cylinder, cone, and sphere. You should be able to easily finish the cube-shaped
      tree for this lab, and the cylinder-, cone- and sphere-shaped trees are left to you as extra
      credit.</p>

      <h4 id="ctor">Each tree &ldquo;seed&rdquo; block has a specialized constructor:</h4>

      </div>

      <h4>Trees will be made out of two types of blocks: log and leaves</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <p>The <code>Blocks.log</code> blocks make up the trunk of the tree, and
        <code>Blocks.leaves</code> make up the body (leaves) of the tree.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>The trunks of the trees are all similar</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <p>Each tree trunk will extend from the ground up to the middle of the leaves. This is
        actually important because Minecraft leaves blocks have an interesting property: </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Leaf blocks start to disappear over time the further they are from a log block</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <p>Blocks.leaves slowly disappear the further they are from a Blocks.log type of block. This
        ends up making trees look more organic, but might surprise you if you're not expecting
        it.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Tree seed blocks will use the following already-supplied textures:</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <ul>
          <li>tree_cube_block</li>
          <li>tree_cylinder_block</li>
          <li>tree_cone_block</li>
          <li>tree_sphere_block</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Trees grow up immediately, so you will implement the <code>onBlockAdded()</code>
          method</h4>
      <div class="indented">

<pre>public void onBlockAdded (World world, int locX, int locY, int locZ) { ... }</pre>

        <p> The code in this method executes as soon as the block is placed in the Minecraft
        world.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Use the <code>world.setBlock()</code> method to place tree blocks</h4>
      <div class="indented">
<pre>void world.setBlock (int locX, int locY, int locZ, Block blockType);</pre>
        <p> Your code inside <code>onBlockAdded()</code> will set blocks at the coordinates [locX,
        locY, locZ]. The entire job in this lab is to put the right blocks at the right coordinates.
        Remember that in Minecraft, the horizon stretches out in X and in Z, and the Y coordinate
        goes up.</p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <div id="tasks" class="indented">

      <p> This lab has four parts. You should be able to easily complete the cube-tree growing block
      in this lab. Parts 2&ndash;4 are increasingly more difficult, but should be achievable with a
      bit of thinking. The challenge for all of these is working out the algorithm and mathematics
      needed to accomplish this.</p>

      <h3>Part 1 &mdash; Create a tree-cube growing block</h3>
      <div class="indented">
        <p> For this task, you'll be creating a tree where the leaves form a cube (all sides
        square), where the length/depth/height of each side is given by the size parameter.</p>

        <ol>
          <li> Create a new class <code>TreeCubeBlock</code>. As usual, this will extend
            <code>Block</code>.</li>

          <li> Add a constructor for <code>TreeCubeBlock</code>. This will take the parameters
            <code>(Material material, int baseHeight, int size)</code>. In the constructor you'll
            need to call the superclass with the <code>material</code> parameter as usual. </li>

          <li> The <code>TreeCubeBlock</code> will have a single method: <code>onBlockAdded</code>.
            In the <code>onBlockAdded</code> method, you'll be calling <code>world.setBlock()</code>
            to place the trunk and leaves. Because the trunk should extend from the ground up into
            the middle of the volume of leaves, it's easier to place all of the leaves first.</li>

          <li> Implement the code to place leaves in a cube shape, <code>baseHeight</code> off the
            ground, and with a side length of <code>size</code>. </li>
          
          <li> Now grow a trunk from the ground up to the middle of the body of leaves. Remember
            that the trunk is built out of <code>Blocks.log</code>. </li>

          <li> Finally, we'll need to add our new custom tree-cube growing block to your inventory
            of custom blocks. Go to the <code>BlocksModule</code> class, and add the new
            <code>TreeCubeBlock</code>. Remember to use the "tree_cube_block" texture for the block,
            and create an instance with a reasonable set of constructor parameters to create a
            reasonably-sized cube tree. </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 2 &mdash; Create a tree-cylinder growing block</h3>
      <div class="indented">
        <p> Now for something a little more difficult: creating a tree in the shape of a cylinder.
        Use the <a href="#ctor">constructor given above</a> in the <a href="#notes">notes</a>
        section above. </p>

        <p> The trick to this part (and the next two parts) is to consider that a cone, cylinder and
        sphere all fit inside a box of some size. You will iterate over all blocks in the world just
        as you did for the cube tree, but then will need to determine whether each block is inside
        or outside of the cylinder. If it's inside (or on the surface of) the cylinder, then set it
        to a leaf block. If a block is outside the cylinder, then don't set it. </p>

        <p> How do you determine if each block is inside the cylinder? That's the puzzle. Don't just
        sit at the computer trying to code it out &mdash; get out a pencil and paper and work it out
        there first. If you're allowed to work in groups, put your heads together to figure it out.
        </p>

        <p> All points in a circle are closer to the center than the radius of that circle. </p>

        <p> Hint: remember the Pythagorean theorem? </p>

        <p> Here's another hint: you can think of a cylinder as a stack of circles. </p>

        <p> Except for the body of the <code>onBlockAdded()</code> method, all of the steps for this
        task are similar to the ones for the tree-cube block. </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 3 &mdash; Create a tree-sphere growing block</h3>
      <div class="indented">
        <p> Now try to figure out how to create a tree with leaves in the shape of a sphere. This
        one is either easier or harder than the cylinder tree, depending on how you think about it.
        Use the <a href="#ctor">constructor given above</a> in the <a href="#notes">notes</a>
        section above. </p>
        
        <p> Hint: all points inside a sphere are closer to the center than the radius of that
        sphere. </p>

        <p> Hint: the Pythagorean theorem works in three dimensions too! </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 4 &mdash; Create a tree-cone growing block</h3>
      <div class="indented">
        <p> Is a cone-tree easier or harder than a sphere tree? I don't know, but I think it might
        be a bit harder. Use the <a href="#ctor">constructor given above</a> in the notes. </p>

        <p> Hint: a cone is like a cylinder, except that the radius decreases to zero as you go
        toward to the top. You'll probably want to copy and tweak your cylinder code, and modify the
        radius in your loops. </p>
