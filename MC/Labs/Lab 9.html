    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <div class="indented">
      <p> In lab 9, you will create a robot that wanders around the map looking for loose items
      like gold or diamond and collecting them. If the entity takes any damage (either by wandering
      into a bad situation, getting attacked by other entities, or getting attacked by other
      players), it drops all of its items and stumbles around for twenty seconds until it has
      recovered enough to continue collecting stuff. While it's dazed, nearby players then have a
      chance to grab the collector bot's loot before it comes to its senses. </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <div id="tasks" class="indented">


      <h3>Part 1 &mdash; Stub In The New <code>CollectorBot</code> Entity</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Start by creating a new class called <code>CollectorBot</code> that extends the
          <code>Robot</code> class. Implement the default constructor that takes in a
          <code>net.minecraft.world.World</code> object as its parameter. Call the super
          constructor with that world parameter. </li>

        <li> In the constructor, add the <code>EntityAIWander</code> task with priority 1.
          When you create the <code>EntityAIWander</code> task, pass in this new collector
          bot and a speed of <code>SPEED_NORMAL</code>. </li>

        <li> Add the new robot to the <code>EntitiesModule</code> class. Register the
          <code>CollectorBot</code> with a name of "collector", and a texture of "gold_robot". </li>

        <li> Start up the game and issue the command "<kbd>/robot collector</kbd>". You should see a
          gold-colored robot that wanders around the map and does nothing else. </li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Part 2 &mdash; Stub In A New <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> Task</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Create a new class called <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> that extends
          <code>EntityAIBase</code>. </li>

        <li> The constructor takes a <code>CollectorBot</code> and a <code>float</code> search
          radius. Store both of these values in member variables of the new task.
          </li>

        <li> Override the methods <code>public boolean shouldExecute()</code> and
          <code>public boolean continueExecuting()</code>. The collection task will run all the
          time at first, so both of these methods should just return true. </li>

        <li> Stub in the override method <code>public void updateTask()</code>. For now, just return
          immediately. </li>

        <li> In the <code>CollectorBot</code> constructor, create a new
          <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> task. The collect-loot task's constructor will take the
          new collector bot's reference and a search radius. Use a search radius of 10. You'll need
          to have access to this task later on, so store a reference to it in a local class member
          variable. Finally, add this task with priority 2. </li>

        <li> Verify your code so far by running the game and issuing the command "<kbd>/robot
          collector</kbd>". You should see a gold-colored robot that still just wanders around the
          map and does nothing else (since the <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> task doesn't yet do
          anything). </li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Part 3 &mdash; Implement Basic <code>CollectorBot</code> Functionality</h3>
      <p class="indented"> Now it's time to implement the basic loot searching and collection task.
        We want the robot to find the nearest piece of loot
        (<code>net.minecraft.entity.item.EntityItem</code>) within its search radius, make its way
        to that item, and then pick it up. </p>

      <ol>

        <li> In the <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> task class, we now need to implement the first
          phase of <code>updateTask()</code>. To begin with, we'll first need a task class variable
          to track the currently targeted piece of loot: call it <code>targetLoot</code>. Loot items
          wil be of type <code>EntityItem</code>. Initialize it to <code>null</code> to begin
          with.</li>

        <li> The <code>updateTask()</code> method has two parts: in the first part, the task is to
          choose a piece of loot if we don't currently have one targeted. In the second part, when
          we have a piece of loot chosen, the task is to move to and collect that item. </li>

        <li> Create a function to select the next piece of loot. It will only be used by the
          <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> task, so it should be private. It will return the
          selected <code>EntityItem</code>, and doesn't need any arguments. Call it
          <code>selectNewTarget</code>. </li>

        <li> <p>In the <code>selectNewTarget</code> function, get a list of all entities in the
          collector bot's world. You will then iterate through this list, and find the entity that
          matches the following criteria:</p>

          <ol class="compact">
            <li> it must be an instance of <code>EntityItem</code>, </li>
            <li> it must not be marked "dead" (<code>item.isDead</code>), and </li>
            <li> it must be within the search radius of the collector bot's location. </li>
            <li> it must be the single closest entity </li>
            </ol>

          <p> (Note that items are marked dead when when they are scheduled to be deleted or are
            destroyed by another entity.) </p>
          </li>

        <li> If you find an item that matches the above criteria, then set that item as the target
          loot, and return the new target. </li>

        <li> At the beginning of <code>updateTask()</code>, if we don't currently have a target loot
          item, get a new piece of target loot using the <code>selectNewTarget()</code> function.
          If we couldn't find a new target item that meets our criteria, then return from
          <code>updateTask()</code>. </li>

        <li> After we've made sure that we have an item as our target loot, check to see if anything
          has marked it as dead. If so, stop the robot's navigation, set <code>targetLoot</code> to
          null, and return from <code>updateTask</code>.

        <li> Move towards the loot target at normal speed. </li>

        <li> If the collector bot is within a distance of 1.5 from the target loot, then it can pick
          it up. Stop the robot navigation, remove the target loot from the world, and set the
          targetLoot to null. </li>

        <li> <p>Test out the collector bot. To do this, load items in your inventory that you can
        drop for the collector bot to find. When you bring up the inventory in game, you can click
        on an item multiple times to create a "stack" of items (you'll see a count over the selected
        item). Drag this stack of items to an inventory slot, and hit escape to get back to the
        game. In game, select the item slot you want, and then drop these items by pressing the
        '<kbd>q</kbd>' key. Now spawn the collector bot with the "<kbd>/robot collector</kbd>"
        command. It should run around and gather up the items you dropped. </p> </li>

      </ol>


      <h3>Part 4 &mdash; Track items in the robot's inventory</h3>
      <p class="indented"> Up to now, the robot really just removes items from the world; it just
      looks like it's been picking them up. Now we need to actually keep track of the items that the
      robot has gathered. We'll need this for the next part, where the robot drops all the items it
      has collected. </p>
      <ol>

        <li> The first task is to add an item inventory to the <code>CollectorBot</code>. We'll use
          a <code>HashMap&lt;Item,Integer&gt;</code> for this. Individual items will be the keys for
          this inventory, and the values will be the total count for each item. Create a class
          member variable for this (name it <code>inventory</code>), and initialize it to a new
          HashMap.</li>

        <li> <p>Add a new <code>CollectorBot</code> method with the following signature:</p>
          <codeBlock>public void addItem (EntityItem <var>entityItem</var>)</codeBlock> </li>

        <li> In the new <code>addItem</code> function, as outlined in the notes section, you'll get
          the item stack from the given <var>entityItem</var>. From that, you'll get the
          item and item count. Compute the new total count for that item type. You will need to
          handle the case where the robot currently has no items of that type, and the case where it
          already has some number of those items. Once you've computed the new total, put that entry
          in the <code>inventory</code> hash map. </li>
          
        <li> It may help to create a small function to print the current robot inventory (using
          <code>System.out.printf()</code>) as you develop this part. See the notes section for a
          way to examine the contents of a hash map, and the tip for getting a printableItemName for
          a given item. You can use this for your inventory print routine, which you can then call
          every time you add a new item. </li>

        <li> Now that you have a way to add and track items to the robot's inventory, we need to
          have the <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> task call this method when we pick up new loot.
          Do this in <code>updateTask()</code>, when we determine that we're within range of our
          target loot. Add the call to <code>robot.addItem</code> when we pick up the target loot.
          </li>

        <li> Is everything implemented correctly? Run the game to find out. Make sure that the robot
          picks up items. If you implemented the debug print function, verify that the inventory is
          growing as you expect. </li>

      </ol>


      <h3>Part 5 &mdash; Drop all items when the robot is damaged</h3>
      <p class="indented"> Now we'll add the behavior that the robot drops all of its inventory
        whenever it receives any damage. </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <p>First, we'll provide an override of the <code>CollectorBot</code>'s
          <code>onEntityDamage</code> method. The signature for this method is</p>
          <codeBlock class="indented">public void onEntityDamage (DamageSource <var>source</var>, float <var>amount</var>);</codeBlock>
          <p>The implementation of this method is simple: just call a new <code>CollectorBot</code>
          method <code>dropInventory()</code> with no arguments.</li>

        <li> Now we need to implement <code>private void dropInventory()</code>. This method needs
          to iterate through all items in its inventory, and drop the correct count of each item.
          See the notes section for <code>dropItem</code>. Once all items have been dropped, clear
          the robot's inventory. The notes section has the information you need on how to clear a
          hash map.</li>

        <li> After dropping the robot's inventory, and if you implemented the
          <code>printInventory</code> debug method, you may want to call this to verify that nothing
          is left in the robot's inventory. </li>

        <li> Time to test. Run the game, toss out a bunch of items for the robot to collect, and
          then smack it. You will probably see that the robot turns red when you hit it, but
          otherwise nothing else will look different. In particular, there won't be a bunch of
          objects laying around the robot. What happened? </li>

        <li> The <code>CollectorBot</code> is very industrious. Even if it properly dropped all of
          its inventory on the ground, the <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code> task is still running,
          so it will just immediately think "look at all this loot!", and pick it right back up. You
          can keep thwacking <code>CollectorBot</code> upside the head, and it will keep dropping
          and immediately picking back up all of its loot until it keels over, keeping everything it
          gathered. Now what? </li>

      </ol>


      <h3>Part 6 &mdash; CollectorBot stops collecting items when damaged</h3>
      <p class="indented"> The key to making <code>CollectorBot</code> more useful is adding a delay
      before it picks up all items it dropped. We'll have the robot wander around stunned for a
      while before the its loot collection task resumes. That will complete our
      <code>CollectorBot</code> implementation. </p>

      <ol>

        <li> In <code>EntityAICollectLoot</code>, we're going to add support for suspending the
          collection task for a period of time. We'll be modifying the <code>shouldExecute</code>
          and <code>continueExecuting</code> tasks to do this. Before we do that, we'll need a new
          private long field named <code>suspendEnt</code> before we start. Initialize it to zero to
          start with. This field will store the time at which task suspension is over. </li>

        <li> Reference the notes section to review system time methods. </li>

        <li> <p> Add a new method with the following signature: </p>
          <codeBlock>public void suspend (float <var>suspendSeconds</var>)</codeBlock>
          <p> This method will take the specified number of seconds and the current time in
          milliseconds, and compute the time when the task suspension should end (also in
          milliseconds). Store that result in <code>suspendEnd</code>. </li>

        <li> If <code>suspendEnd</code> is zero, then we are not suspended. Given that, update the
          <code>continueExecuting</code> method to return true only if we're not currently
          suspended. </li>

        <li> Update the <code>shouldExecute</code> method. Given the current system time and the
          suspendEnd variable, determine if we're still in the suspend time period. If we are still
          suspended, then return false (we should not execute the task). If we are either not
          suspended or are now past the suspension time period, set <code>suspendEnd</code> to zero
          to indicate that the collection task is not suspended, and return true (we should execute
          our main task). </li>

        <li> Back in the <code>CollectorBot</code> class, and using the code we just wrote above,
          suspend the collection task for 20 seconds when we take any damage. </li>

        <li> Time for the final test. Run the game, and feed the collector bot a bunch of items. Now
          smack the bot (from a distance), and you should notice that it drops all of its loot, and
          doesn't pick it back up. (Note that if you're too close, your player will end up picking
          up the items, which is why you want a bit of distance before striking the robot.) Wait 20
          seconds, and verify that the robot starts picking things up again. </li>

      </ol>


      <h3>Part 7 &mdash; Fit & Finish</h3>
        <p class="indented"> Take a look at all of your code. You've added a bunch, changed a bunch,
        and probably wrestled a bit with different parts. How can you make the code cleaner? Easier
        to read? Are you using magic numbers where you should instead have used class constants? Is
        your code well documented? Review the program logic and see if you can accomplish the same
        tasks in simpler ways. How much code can you simplify or reduce? Re-order your methods so
        that reviewers and other programmers can follow the logic easier. Are there places where you
        could use a variable to hold a common result? Are your variable names clear? These are just
        a few things to look at, but make a huge difference in your final result. </p>
