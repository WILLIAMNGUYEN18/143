    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <div class="indented">
      <p>In lab 8, you will create an entity that disguises itself as a neighboring block when it
      is damaged (by anything). After a specific amount of hiding time, it will convert back to a
      normal entity and walk away as if nothing happened.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
    <div class="indented">

      <h4>To add a new task with a specific priority</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <code>tasks.addTask (priority, EntityAIBase);</code>
      </div>

      <h4>To spawn an entity in game</h4>
      <ol class="noSpaceBefore">
        <li>While in the world, hit the "<kbd>t</kbd>" key and on the bottom left of the screen
          you should see a cursor.</li>
        <li>Type "<kbd>/robot <var>entity</var></kbd>" and replace "<var>entity</var>" with
          the name of the registered entity. For this lab, it would be "<kbd>/robot
          chameleon</kbd>".</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Robot Damage Events</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <codeBlock>void Robot.onEntityDamage (DamageSource <var>source</var>, float <var>amount</var>)</codeBlock>
        <p>The above inherited <code>Robot</code> function is called every time your robot entity
          receives any damage. You won't care about the source or amount of damage; it just matters
          that the chameleon bot received <em>some</em> kind of damage.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Controlling entity visibility</h4>
      <div class="indented">
<codeBlock>entity.setInvisible(true);&nbsp;   // Hide entity
entity.setInvisible(false);   // Show entity</codeBlock>
      </div>

      <h4>Getting and setting entity position and orientation</h4>
      <div class="indented">
<codeBlock>double positionX = robot.posX;    // Entity position as double X,Y,Z
double positionY = robot.posY;
double positionZ = robot.posZ;

entity.setLocationAndAngles (
    double x,      // X Coordinate Position
    double y,      // Y Coordinate Position
    double z,      // Z Coordinate Position
    float  yaw,    // Yaw Angle (left-right direction)

      <div class="indented">
<codeBlock>World world = entity.worldObj;   // Get the entity's world

// Get the block at a given world position
Block block = world.getBlock (positionX, positionY, positionZ);

int blockMetadata = world.getBlockMetadata (positionX, positionY, positionZ);

// Set a block at a given position in the world
world.setBlock (

      <p>If you're going to read a block and then later restore it, you'll need to get the block
        metadata as well as the block object itself (using the above functions).</p>

      <h4>System Time</h4>
      <div class="indented">
        <codeBlock>long System.currentTimeMillis()</codeBlock>

        <p>The above method gets the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970. You can use this
        value to figure out the current time. For our purposes, where we need <em>elapsed</em> time,
        you will only care about the <em>difference</em> between timestamps.</p>

        <p>For example:</p>

<codeBlock>long timeThreeSecondsFromNow = (long)(3.0 * 1000) + System.currentTimeMillis();
boolean threeSecondsElapsed = System.currentTimeMillis() &gt; timeThreeSecondsFromNow;</codeBlock>

    <h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
    <div class="indented">


      <h3>Part 1 &mdash; Create an entity that wanders around the world</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start by creating a new class called <code>ChameleonBot</code> that extends the
          <code>Robot</code> class.</li>
          
        <li>Implement the primary constructor. This takes in a
        <code>net.minecraft.world.World</code> parameter and calls the <code>super</code>
        constructor with the <var>world</var> parameter.</li>

        <li>Inside the constructor, add the <code>EntityAIWander</code> task with priority 1.
          When you create the new <code>EntityAIWander</code> task, pass in a reference to this new
          <code>ChameleonBot</code> (<code>this</code>) and the value <code>SPEED_SLOW</code>.</li>

        <li><p>Inside the <code>EntitiesModule</code> class, register the <code>ChameleonBot</code>.
          Use the name "chameleon", and paint it with the "rainbow_robot" texture.</li>

        <li>Test point. Launch the game, go into a world, and summon the chameleon bot. It should
          wander around slowly.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Part 2 &mdash; Modify the entity to convert into a block when harmed</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new class called <code>EntityAIDisguise</code> that extends
          <code>EntityAIBase</code> (<code>net.minecraft.entity.ai.EntityAIBase</code>).</li>

        <li>In the <code>EntityAIDisguise</code> class, create a private field of type
          <code>ChameleonBot</code> named <var>robot</var>.</li>

        <li>Create a constructor that takes in a <code>ChameleonBot</code> parameter and assign that
          value to the private <code>robot</code> field.</li>

        <li>Implement the following stub methods:
          <ul class="compact">
            <li><code>public void startExecuting()</code></li>
            <li><code>public boolean shouldExecute()</code></li>
            <li><code>public void resetTask()</code></li>
            <li><code>public boolean continueExecuting()</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>For now, just return <code>true</code> from <code>shouldExecute()</code> and
          <code>continueExecuting()</code>.</li>

        <li>Now back to the <code>ChameleonBot</code> class. You need to add the
          <code>EntityAIDisguise</code> task to your chameleon bot. You will also want to create a
          private field to keep a reference to this task for later. Add this task with priority 2.
          </li>

        <li>Time to test. Launch the game and summon a new chameleon bot. It should still just
          wander around slowly.
      </ol>


      <h3>Part 3 &mdash; when damaged, the chameleon bot turns into a log</h3>
      <ol>

        <li>First off, we need to add a routine to our chameleon bot called
          <code>hasFreshDamage()</code>. It returns <code>true</code> only if the robot just
          received fresh damage and this is the first time <code>hasFreshDamage()</code> was called
          since then. In other words, if you damage chameleon bot, then the first call to
          <code>hasFreshDamage()</code> will return <code>true</code>, and every other call after
          that (until the next damage event) should return <code>false</code>.</li>

        <li>Here's the general flow of the <code>EntityAIDisguise</code> task:
          <ol class="capitals">
            <li><code>shouldExecute()</code> returns <code>true</code> if the robot has received
              fresh damage.</li>
            <li>If <code>shouldExecute()</code> returns <code>true</code>, then the game will
              automatically call <code>startExecuting()</code>, then <code>updateTask()</code>,
              and then <code>continueExecuting()</code> until <code>continueExecuting()</code>
              returns <code>false</code>.</li>
            <li>The <code>startExecuting()</code> task needs to do the work to disguise the
              robot.</li>
            <li>We don't need to implement the <code>updateTask()</code> function; it does nothing
              for this task.</li>
            <li>The <code>continueExecuting()</code> function will check the time. If the disguise
              period is done, it returns false (stop executing). If the robot is still hiding, then
              return <code>true</code> to keep checking the time.</li>
          </ol></li>

        <li>Implement the <code>shouldExecute()</code> function. This will use the robot's
        <code>hasFreshDamage()</code> function you just wrote.</li>

        <li><p>For part 3, the robot will just turn into a log forever when it receives damage
          (super powers don't come all at once). There are two steps to this:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>First, hide the robot. This part's easy. Just set the robot to invisible, using the
              <code>setInvisible()</code> function from the <a href="#notes">notes</a> above.</li>
            <li>Secondly, we'll need to place a log block where the robot used to be. Get the
              robot's position, convert to the nearest integer coordinates, and set the block
              at that position to <code>Blocks.log</code>.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Test it out. Launch the game, summon a chameleon bot, and smack it. It should turn into
          a log and remain that way.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Part 4 &mdash; Chameleon bot turns back into a chameleon bot after five seconds</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Now let's have the chameleon bot turn back after hiding for five seconds. To do this, we
          need to store the time we'll stop hiding. In the <code>EntityAIDisguise</code> task,
          create a private field of type <code>long</code> that holds the hiding end time. It's also
          good coding style to give all of your numerical constants descriptive names when possible,
          so create another <code>private static final long</code> constant named
          <code>MILLIS_PER_SECOND</code>, which holds the number of milliseconds per second. Use
          this constant when calculating your hiding end time.</li>

        <li>We want to restore the robot to its old location, so also save away its X, Y, and Z
          position coordinates. Though an entities position coordinates are normally
          double-precision floating-point values, you will need to save these as world integer
          coordinates. To assist in this conversion, create a private helper function named
          <code>round</code> that takes a <code>double</code> and returns a rounded
          <code>int</code>. <code>Math.round()</code> will make this task easy. </li>

        <li>Place a <code>Blocks.log</code> block at the robot's old location.</li>

        <li>The <code>continueExecuting()</code> function should return <code>true</code> as long as
          the robot is still in hiding time. When hiding time is over,
          <code>continueExecuting()</code> should return false.</li>

        <li>Now we'll start filling in <code>resetTask()</code>, which will be called when
          <code>continueExecuting()</code> returns false. In this method, set the block at the hide
          position to <code>Blocks.air</code>, and make the robot visible again.</li>

        <li>Now when you test your chameleon bot, it will hide as a log for five seconds, and then
          the log will disappear and the robot will become visible again.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Part 5 &mdash; Chameleon bot blends in with surrounding blocks</h3>
      <p class="indented">Now the chameleon bot will look around itself to figure out which block
        type it should choose to use to hide itself, so that it blends in with the surrounding
        scenery.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the <code>startExecuting()</code> function, calculate the robot hide position
          (nearest integer world coordinates) as before.</li>

        <li>Now have the chameleon look around to find a block to mimic (in the
          <code>startExecuting()</code> function). It will use that nearby block type as its
          disguise.

        <li>
          <p>If the robot's hiding position is <code>hideX</code>, <code>hideY</code> and
            <code>hideZ</code>, then you'll look at neighbors like <code>hideX - 1</code>,
            <code>hideY + 1</code>, and <code>hideZ</code>. Since we'll skip the block exactly at
            the robot's world coordinates (<code>hideX, hideY, hideZ</code>), that leaves 26
            neighboring blocks total to examine. Find one that isn't <code>Blocks.air</code> &mdash;
            that will be the one we impersonate.</p>
          <p>There are several ways to examine all 26 neighboring blocks. You could use a
            two-dimensional array of offsets (-1, 0, +1) and then just check each of those offsets
            in a single loop. Or you could create a triply-nested for loop, which computes offsets
            in X, Y and Z. The implementation is up to you.</p>
        </li>

        <li>When checking neighboring blocks, if the current block is <code>Blocks.air</code>, then
          skip this block and continue looking at neighbors.</li>

        <li><p>If you find a neighboring block that isn't air, then perform the following steps:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Save the neighbor's block and block metadata so we can restore it later (see <a
              href="#notes">notes</a>).</li>

            <li>If you found a good neighbor block to impersonate, you need to replace the block
              at the robot's position, so save off <em>that</em> block and its metadata as well.</li>

            <li>Set the robot to invisible.</li>

            <li>Set the block (and its metadata) at the robot's position to the neighbor block
              information you want to impersonate.</li>

            <li>Once you're done setting up the imposter block, you can return from the
              <code>startExecuting()</code> function.
          </ol>
          </li>

        <li>If you make it out of the search loop(s) without finding any neighbor blocks that aren't
          air, then the chameleon bot has nothing to mimic, so it can't disguise itself. In this
          case, set the hiding end time to the current time, and set the replaced block field to
          null.</li>

        <li>In the <code>resetTask()</code> function, you'll only restore the hiding position to the
          original block if the chameleon bot was able to hide (if the replacedBlock field isn't
          null). In this case, set the imposter block back to its original value, and also restore
          its original metadata.</li>

        <li>Finally (in <code>resetTask()</code>), set the chameleon bot's position to its original
          hiding position, and set its <var>yaw</var> and <var>pitch</var> angles to 0 (see <a
          href="#notes">notes</a>). After that make the robot visible again.</li>

        <li>That's it! Perform a final test of your robot. When you damage it, it should change into
          a block of the same type as the surrounding landscape. After five seconds, the imposter
          block should disappear, the original landscape block should be restored, and the chameleon
          bot should reappear in the original location.</li>
      </ol>
